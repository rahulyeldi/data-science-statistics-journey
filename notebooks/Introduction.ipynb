    "# Introduction to Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is like a **toolkit** we use to understand and make sense of information.  \n",
    "It helps us **collect**, **organize**, **analyze**, and **interpret** data to find patterns, trends, and relationships in the world around us.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Statistics Classification\n",

    "## Types of Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "Used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- Calculating the average height of students in a class  \n",
    "- Creating a bar chart showing the distribution of exam scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferential Statistics\n",
    "Used to make generalizations and predictions about a population based on a sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- Using a survey of a sample of voters to predict the outcome of an election  \n",
    "- Conducting a clinical trial to determine if a new drug is effective for a larger population\n",

    "## Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Qualitative Data**: Descriptive information  \n",
    "   - *Example*: She is beautiful, He is tall\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quantitative Data**: Numerical information  \n",
    "   - *Example*: A horse has four legs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtypes of Quantitative Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Discrete Data**: Has fixed values and can be counted  \n",
    "- **Continuous Data**: Has a range of values and can be measured\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample (n) and Population (N)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **n: Sample Size**  \n",
    "  Refers to the number of elements in your sample (a subset of the population).  \n",
    "  - *Example*: If you survey 50 interns from Bangalore, then `n = 50`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N: Population Size**  \n",
    "  Refers to the total number of elements in the entire population.  \n",
    "  - *Example*: If you're studying all Vodafone interns across India, then `N` is the total number of interns\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Levels of Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nominal**  \n",
    "   - Data is categorized into distinct groups with no inherent order  \n",
    "   - *Examples*: Colors (red, blue, green), types of fruit (apple, banana), gender (male, female)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ordinal**  \n",
    "   - Data can be categorized and ranked, but intervals between ranks are not equal  \n",
    "   - *Examples*: Educational levels (high school, bachelor's, master's), satisfaction ratings (very satisfied, satisfied)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interval**  \n",
    "   - Data has a specific order and equal intervals, but no true zero point  \n",
    "   - *Examples*: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, IQ scores, calendar years\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ratio**  \n",
    "   - Has all characteristics of the others plus a true zero point  \n",
    "   - *Examples*: Height, weight, age, time spent on a task\n",
    "\n",
